# FTP HTTP middleware
## What it does
If you have an FTP server and you (or others) want to access it through HTTP, configure this software on your webserver. You will be able to use your browser as an FTP client.
You can find an example of a similar software here: https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/doc/. As you can see, it's an FTP server reached over HTTP.
## How to configure it
You have to use a webserver in order to run this software.
In /includes/server_configs.php you will find the configuration file.

There's no CSS so it will be easy to customize.
